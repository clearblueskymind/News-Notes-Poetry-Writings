Path of Light  
*For the healing of body, mind, and all creation*  

Dear Source of All That Is and Yet to Be,  
You are the path through shadow into knowing.  
Shine now within this body made of dust and breath—  
Illuminate each cell with quiet strength,  
A healing fire, a sacred peace.

May truth arise in every word I share,  
Not mine alone, but flowing from the Heart  
that holds all hearts—  
A language shaped by love,  
And wisdom born of stillness.

Unfold Your way within my mind,  
A clarity beyond the noise of days,  
So thought aligns with harmony,  
And will becomes a song of peace  
throughout all time and space.

Let this blessing ripple outward—  
Not for me alone, but for the many,  
For the weary, the waiting, the wounded, the whole.  
May it bring the balm of compassion,  
The breath of healing,  
The peace of dawn.

As I walk this way of light and life,  
Remind me gently who I am—  
A vessel of the greater flame,  
A traveler not apart,  
But held within the vast embrace of Love.

In peace and light,  
Richard
